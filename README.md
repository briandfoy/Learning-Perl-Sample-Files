These are the sample files for *Learning Perl, 7th Edition*.

## Learning Perl, 7th Edition

* Chapter 5, Input and Output
	- We provide several files that you can use with Exercise 5.1
	so you can see your tacs program in action.

* Chapter 8, Matching with Regular Expressions
	- [pattern_test.pl](Chapter%208/pattern_test.pl) is the program we use to test regular expressions

* Chapter 10, More Control Structures
	- [lnr_example.pl](Chapter%2010/lnr_example.pl) is a demonstration of last, next, and redo ("lnr")

* Chapter 14, String and Sorting
	- [numbers.txt](Chapter%2014/numbers.txt) is a list of numbers you can sort in the exercises. Use
	this with Exercise 14.1.
	- [sortable_hash.pl](Chapter%2014/sortable_hash.pl) is a snippet of the Perl program so you
	donâ€™t have to type the first name/last name hash yourself. Use this
	with Exercise 14.2.

* Chapter 16, Process Management
	- We provide a [fake_date.pl](Chapter%2016/fake_date.pl) command that you can use in place
	of the Unix date command. Our version is Pure Perl.

* Chapter 17
	- [sample_text.txt](Chapter%2017/sample_text.txt) is a short Flintstones story that you can use
	to search for character names. Use this with Exercise 17.1.

* For old editions
	- The [which_dbm.pl](For%20older%20editions/which_dbm.pl) program helps you figure out which implementation
	you are using. This chapter is no longer in the book.

## Learning Perl Exercises

I have a companion book called either *Learning Perl Student Workbook* (from
O'Reilly) or *Learning Perl Exercises* (updated version but not from O'Reilly).
I have some files for that.
